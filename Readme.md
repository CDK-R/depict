# depict

`depict` is an R/RJava wrapper around the wonderful depiction api written by [John May](https://github.com/johnmay).  The entire [CDK](https://github.com/cdk) team, but especially John, have been steadily improving the visualization features of CDK. 

The depiction API is succinct and powerful and provides access to a vary large amount of the end-user desired functionality with a small number of composable functions. Because of the design of this API it is now relatively straightforward to design a simple streamlined interface to allow users to quickly and easily generate beautiful graphics.


## Installation

You can install depict from github with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CDK-R/depict")
```

## Usage

You can find usage documentation on `depict`'s [Github Website](https://cdk-r.github.io/depict/).
